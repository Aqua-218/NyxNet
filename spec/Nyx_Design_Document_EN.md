## 9. Implementation Strategy

### 9.1 Language and Platform Choices
#### Rust Implementation
**Advantages:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions for high performance
- Excellent async/await support
- Strong type system prevents many classes of bugs

**Design Decisions:**
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` for maximum safety
- `tokio` async runtime for scalable I/O
- `quinn` as QUIC implementation reference
- `cargo-fuzz` for comprehensive fuzz testing

#### Cross-Platform Support
| Platform | Status | Considerations |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Linux | Primary | Full feature support |
| Windows | Supported | WinAPI integration |
| macOS | Supported | Network extension requirements |
| Mobile (iOS/Android) | Planned → Implementing | Power management, background operation (see Mobile section) |
| WebAssembly | Research → Policy | Browser limitations; feature subset via `nyx-sdk-wasm` |

##### WebAssembly Policy (Browser/WASI)

- Scope: Provide a browser-compatible subset through `nyx-sdk-wasm` without relying on raw UDP/QUIC datagrams.
- Supported (browser):
  - Noise handshake demo (`noise_handshake_demo`) for cryptographic showcase
  - Push registration helper (`nyx_register_push`) returning endpoint for Nyx Gateway integration
- Unsupported (browser):
  - HPKE (until wasm-safe primitives and stable RNG/KEM are exposed)
  - Multipath data plane (no low-level socket access; QUIC datagrams not available universally)
  - Plugin system (no dynamic loading sandbox in standard browser environment)
  - Close-code mapping/capability negotiation (requires full stream/protocol layer)
- WASI target: server-side WASM may enable broader capabilities; mapping follows native feature-gating.
- Security: All cryptographic operations are constrained to wasm-safe APIs and avoid non-deterministic host dependencies.

### 9.2 Development Methodology
#### Safety-First Development
- **Formal Verification**: TLA+ models for critical protocols
- **Property Testing**: QuickCheck-style property verification
- **Fuzz Testing**: Continuous fuzzing of all input parsers
- **Static Analysis**: Multiple static analysis tools in CI

#### Quality Assurance
```rust
// Example: Mandatory unsafe-free code
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
#![deny(missing_docs)]
#![warn(clippy::all)]

// Example: Comprehensive testing
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use quickcheck::quickcheck;
    
    #[quickcheck]
    fn packet_parse_roundtrip(data: Vec<u8>) -> bool {
        // Property: parsing then serializing should be identity
        if let Ok(packet) = Packet::parse(&data) {
            packet.serialize() == data
        } else {
            true // Invalid input is fine
        }
    }
}
```

```tla
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets

VARIABLES 
    nodes,           \* Set of network nodes
    connections,     \* Active connections

## 11. Deployment Considerations

### 11.1 Network Infrastructure
#### Mix Node Requirements
- **Minimum Specifications**: 2 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM, 100 Mbps network
- **Recommended Specifications**: 8 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, 1 Gbps network
- **Geographic Distribution**: Nodes in multiple countries and continents
- **Organizational Diversity**: Operated by different entities

#### Rendezvous Infrastructure
- **High Availability**: Multiple servers with load balancing
- **Geographic Distribution**: Servers in major regions
- **Privacy Protection**: Minimal logging and data retention
- **DDoS Protection**: Robust protection against network attacks

### 11.2 Client Deployment
#### Desktop Applications
- **Installation**: Native packages for major operating systems
- **Configuration**: Automatic configuration with manual override
- **Updates**: Secure automatic updates with cryptographic verification
- **Integration**: System-wide proxy and application-specific integration

#### Mobile Applications
- **iOS**: Network extension for system-wide protection
- **Android**: VPN service for traffic routing
- **Battery Optimization**: Adaptive protocols for power efficiency
- **Background Operation**: Maintain connections during app suspension

##### Mobile (iOS/Android) — Power Management & Background Operation

This section specifies the concrete implementation policy for mobile power management and background operation. It aligns with the internal guides in `docs/LOW_POWER_MODE.md` and `docs/MOBILE_POWER_PUSH_INTEGRATION.md`, and defines stable integration surfaces for `nyx-mobile-ffi/`.

• Objectives
- Maintain anonymity properties while reducing energy consumption during background or idle states
- Minimize wake-to-availability latency when new data arrives
- Preserve NAT bindings and path viability using the lowest necessary background traffic

• Unified State Model
- ACTIVE: Full functionality, normal cover traffic and probing
- BACKGROUND: Reduced cover ratio, low-frequency keepalive, extended rekey intervals
- INACTIVE: Suspend active probing; rely on push-triggered resume
- CRITICAL: Aggressive suppression for low battery, minimal keepalive only

• iOS Strategy
- Background execution relies on a combination of:
  - Push-triggered resume via APNs remote notifications with `content-available` for wake signals (silent notifications are not guaranteed and may be coalesced by the system)
  - Background tasks scheduled with the BackgroundTasks framework (e.g., `BGAppRefreshTask`/`BGProcessingTask`) for maintenance operations within OS quotas
  - Network extension or app-scoped operation depending on product form factor; networking work must respect background execution budgets
- On receiving a wake signal, the app requests a fast resume path: one control path plus one data path. Connection re-establishment must be bounded with exponential backoff and debouncing to avoid budget exhaustion.
- Payloads in push wake are minimal (topic + nonce). Application-level keys provide AEAD protection; failed decryptions are ignored.

• Android Strategy
- Respect Doze and App Standby:
  - Use FCM high-priority data messages only for truly time-sensitive wake signals
  - Use WorkManager for deferred maintenance and periodic tasks; use constraints to avoid waking radio unnecessarily
  - For immediate user-visible work, switch to a foreground service with the proper service type and notification policy
- Resume flow mirrors iOS: debounce, capped retries with backoff, and minimal initial path set. Keepalives are adaptive to radio state and policies.

• FFI/API Integration
- `nyx-mobile-ffi` must expose:
  - Power/app lifecycle events into the daemon (`nyx_power_set_state`, screen on/off, charging state, low power mode)
  - Push wake entry point (`nyx_push_wake`) that feeds the resume controller
  - Explicit resume trigger (`nyx_resume_low_power_session`) used by the mobile glue when the OS grants execution time
- The daemon's LowPowerManager attaches a PushGatewayManager to coordinate wake-driven reconnection and record telemetry (wake counts, reconnect attempts, latency p50/p95).

• Cover Traffic and Rekey Adaptation
- BACKGROUND: reduce cover ratio and probing frequency; increase HPKE rekey intervals moderately
- INACTIVE/CRITICAL: suspend probing, keep minimal NAT keepalive traffic; increase rekey interval further
- Maintain a minimum Poisson λ for indistinguishability; apply random jitter to state transitions to avoid synchronization spikes

• Observability & Safety
- Record state transitions, wake events, reconnect success/failure, and latency quantiles
- Enforce guardrails for retry/backoff and execution windows to avoid violating OS background restrictions
- Ensure all sensitive push payloads are minimized and encrypted end-to-end

For detailed operational guidance and API examples, see `docs/LOW_POWER_MODE.md` and `docs/MOBILE_POWER_PUSH_INTEGRATION.md`.

### 11.3 Operational Considerations
#### Monitoring and Metrics
```rust
// OpenTelemetry integration for observability
use opentelemetry::trace::{Tracer, TracerProvider};

#[tracing::instrument]
async fn handle_connection(connection: Connection) {
    let span = tracer.start("nyx.connection.handle");
    span.set_attribute("connection.id", connection.id().to_string());
    
    // Handle connection with full tracing
    let result = process_connection(connection).await;
    
    span.set_attribute("connection.result", result.to_string());
    span.end();
}
```

#### Logging and Privacy
- **Minimal Logging**: Log only essential operational information
- **Data Retention**: Short retention periods with automatic deletion
- **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information from logs
- **Compliance**: GDPR and other privacy regulation compliance
