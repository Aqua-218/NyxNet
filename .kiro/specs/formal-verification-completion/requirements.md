# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the formal verification infrastructure for the Nyx protocol by implementing comprehensive safety proofs, model checking, and property-based testing. The goal is to provide mathematical guarantees about the correctness and safety properties of the multipath plugin system and core protocol components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Safety Property Proofs

**User Story:** As a protocol developer, I want complete formal proofs of safety and liveness properties, so that I can guarantee the protocol behaves correctly under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TLA+ model is executed THEN all safety invariants SHALL be formally proven
2. WHEN capability negotiation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between supported and required capabilities
3. WHEN path selection happens THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate nodes in paths
4. WHEN state transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain valid state relationships
5. WHEN liveness properties are checked THEN the system SHALL eventually progress from initial state
6. IF capability mismatch occurs THEN the system SHALL transition to error state with correct error code

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Model Checking

**User Story:** As a protocol implementer, I want comprehensive TLC model checking coverage, so that I can verify the protocol works correctly across all possible execution paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TLC model checker runs THEN it SHALL verify all invariants across the complete state space
2. WHEN different node counts are tested THEN the model SHALL handle scalability correctly
3. WHEN various capability sets are tested THEN negotiation SHALL work for all combinations
4. WHEN path lengths vary THEN the system SHALL maintain correctness for all valid lengths (3-7)
5. WHEN temporal properties are checked THEN liveness and fairness SHALL be verified
6. IF model checking finds violations THEN they SHALL be documented with counterexamples

### Requirement 3: Extended Property-Based Testing

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want comprehensive property-based tests, so that I can verify implementation correctness against the formal model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multipath selection is tested THEN it SHALL generate valid paths with no duplicates
2. WHEN capability negotiation is tested THEN it SHALL match the TLA+ model behavior
3. WHEN protocol state machines are tested THEN they SHALL maintain invariants under all inputs
4. WHEN cryptographic operations are tested THEN they SHALL preserve security properties
5. WHEN network simulation runs THEN it SHALL verify end-to-end protocol behavior
6. WHEN error conditions are injected THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
7. IF property violations are found THEN they SHALL provide minimal failing examples
