# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the CLI and SDK functionality for the Nyx project, which is a high priority item. Based on the Nyx Protocol v0.1/v1.0 specifications, the CLI (nyx-cli) needs benchmark functionality with actual Nyx stream data transmission, detailed statistics including latency distribution and percentiles, connection features using the Nyx Secure Stream Layer, and error statistics with Prometheus metrics integration. The SDK (nyx-sdk) needs actual daemon communication via gRPC, stream read/write capabilities implementing AsyncRead/AsyncWrite over Nyx streams, auto-reconnection with exponential backoff, and a comprehensive event system for network state changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Nyx network developer, I want complete benchmark functionality in the CLI, so that I can measure actual Nyx stream performance including mix routing latency and throughput statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmark command THEN the CLI SHALL establish Nyx streams through the daemon and perform actual data transmission via Mix Routing Layer
2. WHEN benchmark completes THEN the CLI SHALL calculate statistics including throughput, latency (per-hop and end-to-end), packet loss, and FEC recovery rates
3. WHEN benchmark runs THEN the CLI SHALL measure latency distribution with percentile values (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th) and display results in human-readable format
4. IF benchmark encounters errors THEN the CLI SHALL categorize errors by layer (Stream, Mix, FEC, Transport) and continue measurement with error statistics
5. WHEN benchmark finishes THEN the CLI SHALL save results in JSON format compatible with the telemetry schema defined in the design document

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Nyx network operator, I want detailed statistics display in the CLI, so that I can monitor Nyx network performance and identify bottlenecks in the protocol stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting statistics THEN the CLI SHALL display latency distribution with percentile breakdown for each protocol layer (Stream, Mix, FEC, Transport)
2. WHEN showing statistics THEN the CLI SHALL include Nyx-specific metrics: cover traffic ratio, hop count distribution, FEC redundancy effectiveness, and connection quality per CID
3. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN the CLI SHALL format data in tables showing per-stream metrics and aggregate network health indicators
4. IF no data is available THEN the CLI SHALL display guidance on enabling telemetry and connecting to the daemon
5. WHEN statistics are requested THEN the CLI SHALL allow filtering by time range, CID, and protocol layer with real-time updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Nyx network user, I want complete connection functionality in the CLI, so that I can establish actual Nyx streams with proper mix routing and test end-to-end connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using connect command THEN the CLI SHALL establish Nyx Secure Stream connections through the daemon with proper Noise_Nyx handshake
2. WHEN connection is established THEN the CLI SHALL enable bidirectional data transfer using STREAM frames with flow control
3. WHEN transferring data THEN the CLI SHALL handle large files through stream multiplexing and display real-time transfer progress
4. IF connection fails THEN the CLI SHALL provide detailed error information including handshake failures, mix routing issues, and NAT traversal problems
5. WHEN connection is active THEN the CLI SHALL display real-time metrics: current hop path, RTT per hop, bandwidth utilization, and cover traffic status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Nyx network administrator, I want error statistics functionality in the CLI, so that I can analyze Prometheus metrics from the daemon and troubleshoot protocol-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting error statistics THEN the CLI SHALL connect to the daemon's Prometheus metrics endpoint and retrieve Nyx-specific metrics
2. WHEN analyzing metrics THEN the CLI SHALL parse and categorize errors by Nyx protocol layers and error codes defined in the specification
3. WHEN displaying error statistics THEN the CLI SHALL show error trends, frequencies by error type, and correlation with network conditions
4. IF Prometheus is unavailable THEN the CLI SHALL fall back to querying daemon directly via gRPC for error statistics
5. WHEN error analysis completes THEN the CLI SHALL provide actionable recommendations based on Nyx protocol troubleshooting guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Nyx SDK user, I want actual daemon communication instead of simulation, so that I can build real applications that interact with the Nyx network through the daemon's gRPC API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SDK initializes THEN it SHALL establish gRPC communication with nyxd daemon using the NyxControl service definition
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the SDK SHALL send real OpenStream, CloseStream, and SubscribeEvents requests with proper error handling
3. WHEN daemon is unavailable THEN the SDK SHALL provide clear error messages and implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. IF gRPC connection fails THEN the SDK SHALL attempt reconnection following the daemon's health check protocol
5. WHEN communication is established THEN the SDK SHALL maintain connection health monitoring and handle daemon restarts gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Nyx SDK developer, I want actual stream read/write functionality, so that I can process real data through AsyncRead/AsyncWrite interfaces over Nyx streams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating streams THEN the SDK SHALL implement AsyncRead and AsyncWrite traits that interface with actual Nyx Secure Stream Layer
2. WHEN reading data THEN the SDK SHALL handle STREAM frames with proper buffering, flow control, and frame reassembly
3. WHEN writing data THEN the SDK SHALL fragment data into STREAM frames, handle backpressure, and ensure data integrity through the protocol stack
4. IF stream errors occur THEN the SDK SHALL provide detailed error information including Nyx error codes and recovery options
5. WHEN streams are closed THEN the SDK SHALL send proper CLOSE frames and perform cleanup following the Nyx protocol state machine

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Nyx SDK user, I want automatic reconnection functionality, so that my applications can handle network interruptions and daemon restarts gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection is lost THEN the SDK SHALL automatically attempt reconnection using the same exponential backoff strategy as the daemon
2. WHEN reconnecting THEN the SDK SHALL implement jittered exponential backoff with configurable maximum retry attempts
3. WHEN reconnection succeeds THEN the SDK SHALL restore stream state where possible and notify applications of connection recovery
4. IF reconnection fails repeatedly THEN the SDK SHALL provide configurable failure handling including circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN reconnection is in progress THEN the SDK SHALL queue operations and provide connection state notifications to applications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Nyx SDK developer, I want a comprehensive event system, so that I can handle all Nyx network events and implement proper callbacks for protocol state changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events occur THEN the SDK SHALL emit structured events for stream state changes, connection events, and protocol-specific notifications
2. WHEN registering callbacks THEN the SDK SHALL support event types including StreamOpened, StreamClosed, ConnectionLost, PathChanged, and ErrorOccurred
3. WHEN events are processed THEN the SDK SHALL ensure thread-safe event handling using Rust's async/await patterns
4. IF event processing fails THEN the SDK SHALL log errors using the tracing framework and continue processing other events
5. WHEN events are no longer needed THEN the SDK SHALL provide cleanup mechanisms for event handlers and prevent memory leaks
