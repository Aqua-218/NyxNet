# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the daemon integration for the Nyx project, which is the highest priority item. The daemon serves as the central coordination point for all Nyx network components including crypto, stream, mix, FEC, and transport layers. Currently, the daemon has partial implementations but needs complete integration of all layers and proper configuration management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Nyx network operator, I want all protocol layers to be fully integrated in the daemon, so that I can run a complete Nyx node with all functionality working together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daemon starts THEN it SHALL initialize crypto, stream, mix, fec, and transport layers successfully
2. WHEN a layer fails to initialize THEN the daemon SHALL log the error and attempt graceful degradation or shutdown
3. WHEN all layers are initialized THEN the daemon SHALL report ready status via gRPC health check
4. IF any layer becomes unavailable during runtime THEN the daemon SHALL attempt to restart that layer and maintain service continuity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Nyx network client, I want DHT integration with the control plane, so that I can discover and connect to other nodes in the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daemon starts THEN it SHALL connect to the DHT control plane
2. WHEN a node joins the network THEN the daemon SHALL register itself in the DHT
3. WHEN looking for peers THEN the daemon SHALL query the DHT for available nodes
4. IF DHT connection is lost THEN the daemon SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHEN DHT operations fail THEN the daemon SHALL fall back to cached peer information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Nyx network user, I want proper path building with actual hop selection, so that my traffic is routed through multiple nodes for privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing a connection THEN the daemon SHALL select multiple hops based on network topology
2. WHEN current implementation uses localhost THEN it SHALL be replaced with actual peer selection logic
3. WHEN selecting hops THEN the daemon SHALL consider node reliability, latency, and geographic distribution
4. IF a hop becomes unavailable THEN the daemon SHALL rebuild the path with alternative nodes
5. WHEN path building fails THEN the daemon SHALL retry with different node selection criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want dynamic configuration management, so that I can update daemon settings without restarting the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the daemon SHALL reload settings without service interruption
2. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the daemon SHALL reject changes and maintain current settings
3. WHEN configuration reload occurs THEN the daemon SHALL validate all settings before applying
4. IF configuration reload fails THEN the daemon SHALL log the error and continue with previous configuration
5. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the daemon SHALL notify connected clients of relevant changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery, so that the daemon can handle failures gracefully and maintain service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN the daemon SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN recoverable errors occur THEN the daemon SHALL attempt automatic recovery
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the daemon SHALL perform graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
4. IF memory or resource limits are reached THEN the daemon SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the daemon SHALL resume normal operation and clear error states
