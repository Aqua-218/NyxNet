# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NyxNet workspace currently has numerous compilation errors across multiple crates that prevent successful builds. These errors include missing dependencies, type mismatches, API incompatibilities, and structural issues. This feature aims to systematically resolve all compilation errors to restore a working build state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all crates in the workspace to compile successfully, so that I can build and test the NyxNet system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cargo check --workspace` THEN the system SHALL complete without any compilation errors
2. WHEN building individual crates THEN each crate SHALL compile successfully without errors
3. WHEN running `cargo build --workspace` THEN the system SHALL produce working binaries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing dependencies to be properly declared, so that all required functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a crate uses external functionality THEN the system SHALL have the corresponding dependency declared in Cargo.toml
2. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL have proper use statements and dependency declarations
3. IF a dependency is missing THEN the system SHALL add it to the appropriate Cargo.toml file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type mismatches to be resolved, so that the code follows Rust's type system correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL provide the correct number and types of arguments
2. WHEN working with async code THEN the system SHALL properly handle Future types and await syntax
3. WHEN using generic types THEN the system SHALL ensure type compatibility across the codebase

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API compatibility issues to be resolved, so that the code works with current dependency versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using external crate APIs THEN the system SHALL use the correct method signatures and available functions
2. WHEN trait implementations are required THEN the system SHALL implement all required trait methods
3. IF API changes have occurred THEN the system SHALL update code to match current API versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structural code issues to be fixed, so that the code follows Rust syntax and semantic rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining functions THEN the system SHALL use proper parameter syntax
2. WHEN implementing traits THEN the system SHALL provide all required methods
3. WHEN using language features THEN the system SHALL follow Rust's ownership and borrowing rules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused code warnings to be addressed, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are unused THEN the system SHALL either use them or prefix with underscore
2. WHEN imports are unused THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary imports
3. WHEN code is unreachable THEN the system SHALL either make it reachable or remove it
